# Science-simulations-II---SPH
UZH course ESC II (computer simulations in science II), writing a smooth particle hydrodynamics program. 

First exercise: create a partitioning algorithm. It takes randomly distributed particles (coordinates) in a plane and splits the plane, creating cells, until each cell contains at most x amount of particles. It plots the particles and the cells.
